.SH NAME
dnssec-settime \- Set the key timing metadata for a DNSSEC key
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP 14
\fBdnssec\-revoke\fR [\fB\-hr\fR] [\fB\-K\ \fIdirectory\fR\fR] [\fB\-P\ \fIdate/offset\fR\fR] [\fB\-A\ \fIdate/offset\fR\fR] [\fB\-R\ \fIdate/offset\fR\fR] [\fB\-U\ \fIdate/offset\fR\fR] [\fB\-D\ \fIdate/offset\fR\fR] [\fB\-v\ \fIlevel\fR\fR] {keyfile}
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBdnssec\-settime\fR reads a DNSSEC private key file, sets the key timing metadata as specified by the \fB\-P\fR, \fB\-A\fR, \fB\-R\fR, \fB\-U\fR, and \fB\-D\fR options\&.
.PP
If none of these options is set on the command line, then \fBdnssec\-settime\fR simply prints the key timing metadata already stored in the key\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\-h
Emit usage message and exit\&.
.TP
\-K \fIdirectory\fR
Sets the directory in which the key files are to reside\&.
.TP
\-P \fIdate/offset\fR
Sets the date on which a key is to be published to the zone\&. After that date, the key will be included in the zone but will not be used to sign it\&.
Dates can be expressed in the format YYYYMMDD or YYYYMMDDHHMMSS\&. If the argument begins with a '+' or '\-', it is interpreted as an offset from the present time\&. If an offset is followed by one of the characters 'y', 'm', 'w', 'd', or 'h', then the offset is computed in years, months, weeks, days, or hours, respectively; otherwise it is computed in seconds\&.
.TP
\-A \fIdate/offset\fR
Sets the date on which the key is to be activated\&. After that date, the key will be included and the zone and used to sign it\&.
The date/offset syntax is identical to that in the \fB\-P\fR option\&.
.TP
\-R \fIdate/offset\fR
Sets the date on which the key is to be revoked\&. After that date, the key will be flagged as revoked\&. It will be included in the zone and will be used to sign it\&.
The date/offset syntax is identical to that in the \fB\-P\fR option\&.
.TP
\-U \fIdate/offset\fR
Sets the date on which the key is to be unpublished\&. After that date, the key will no longer be included in the zone, but it may remain in the key repository\&.
The date/offset syntax is identical to that in the \fB\-P\fR option\&.
.TP
\-D \fIdate/offset\fR
Sets the date on which the key is to be deleted\&. After that date, the key can be removed from the key repository\&.
The date/offset syntax is identical to that in the \fB\-P\fR option\&.
.TP
\-v \fIlevel\fR
Sets the debugging level\&.
