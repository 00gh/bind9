.SH NAME
dnssec-dsfromkey \- DNSSEC DS RR generation tool
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP 17
\fBdnssec\-dsfromkey\fR [\fB\-v\ \fIlevel\fR\fR] [\fB\-1\fR] [\fB\-2\fR] [\fB\-a\ \fIalg\fR\fR] {keyfile}
.HP 17
\fBdnssec\-dsfromkey\fR {\-s} [\fB\-v\ \fIlevel\fR\fR] [\fB\-1\fR] [\fB\-2\fR] [\fB\-a\ \fIalg\fR\fR] [\fB\-c\ \fIclass\fR\fR] [\fB\-d\ \fIdir\fR\fR] {dnsname}
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBdnssec\-dsfromkey\fR outputs the Delegation Signer (DS) resource record (RR), as defined in RFC 3658 and RFC 4509, for the given key(s)\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\-1
Use SHA\-1 as the digest algorithm (the default is to use both SHA\-1 and SHA\-256)\&.
.TP
\-2
Use SHA\-256 as the digest algorithm\&.
.TP
\-a \fIalgorithm\fR
Select the digest algorithm\&. The value of \fBalgorithm\fR must be one of SHA\-1 (SHA1) or SHA\-256 (SHA256)\&. These values are case insensitive\&.
.TP
\-v \fIlevel\fR
Sets the debugging level\&.
.TP
\-l \fIdomain\fR
Generate a DLV set instead of a DS set\&. The specified \fBdomain\fR is appended to the name for each record in the set\&.
.TP
\-s
Keyset mode: in place of the keyfile name, the argument is the DNS domain name of a keyset file\&. Following options make sense only in this mode\&.
.TP
\-c \fIclass\fR
Specifies the DNS class (default is IN), useful only in the keyset mode\&.
.TP
\-d \fIdirectory\fR
Look for \fIkeyset\fR files in \fBdirectory\fR as the directory, ignored when not in the keyset mode\&.
.SH "EXAMPLE"
.PP
To build the SHA\-256 DS RR from the \fBKexample\&.com\&.+003+26160\fR keyfile name, the following command would be issued:
.PP
\fBdnssec\-dsfromkey \-2 Kexample\&.com\&.+003+26160\fR 
.PP
The command would print something like:
.PP
\fBexample\&.com\&. IN DS 26160 5 2 3A1EADA7A74B8D0BA86726B0C227AA85AB8BBD2B2004F41A868A54F0 C5EA0B94\fR 
.SH "FILES"
.PP
The keyfile can be designed by the key identification \fIKnnnn\&.+aaa+iiiii\fR or the full file name \fIKnnnn\&.+aaa+iiiii\&.key\fR as generated by dnssec\-keygen(8)\&.
.PP
The keyset file name is built from the \fBdirectory\fR, the string \fIkeyset\-\fR and the \fBdnsname\fR\&.
.SH "CAVEAT"
.PP
A keyfile error can give a "file not found" even if the file exists\&.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
\fBdnssec\-keygen\fR(8), \fBdnssec\-signzone\fR(8), BIND 9 Administrator Reference Manual, RFC 3658, RFC 4509\&.
