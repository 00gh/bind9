.ds vT BIND9 Programmer's Manual
.Sh NAME
.Nm rdnc.conf
.Nd rdnc configuration file
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm rdnc.conf
.Sh DESCRIPTION 
The BIND9 utility for controlling the name server,
.Nm rndc ,
has its own configuration file
.Pa /etc/rndc.conf .
This file has a similar structure and syntax to
.Pa named.conf ,
the file used to configure the name server.
Statements are enclosed in braces and terminated with a semi-colon.
Clauses in the statements are also semi-colon terminated.
The usual comment styles are supported:
.Bl -tag -width UNIX-style:
.It C style: /* */
.It C++ style: // to end of line
.It Unix style: # to end of line
.El
.Pp
.Pa rndc.conf
is much simpler than
.Pa named.conf .
The file uses three statements: an
.Dv options{}
statement, a
.Dv server{}
statement and a
.Dv key{}
statement.
.Pp
The
.Dv options{}
statement contains two clauses.
The
.Dv default-server
clause
is followed by the name of a name server.
This must be identified by a
.Dv server{}
statement elsewhere in the file.
This server will
be used when no name server is given as an argument to
.Nm rndc .
The
.Dv default-key
clause
is followed by the name of a key which is identified by a 
.Dv key{}
statement.
If no other suitable key can be found in the file, this default key
will be used to authenticate commands sent to the name
server and its responses.
The key name is enclosed in double quotes.
.Pp
After the keyword
.Dv server ,
the 
.Dv server{}
statement is followed by a string which is the hostname for the
name server.
The statement has a single clause:
.Dv key .
This contains the name of a key which is enclosed in double quotes.
The key name must match the name of a
.Dv key{}
statement in the file.
.Pp
The
.Dv key{}
statement begins with an identifying string - the name of the key.
The statement has two clauses.
.Dv algorithm
identifies the encryption algorithm for
.Nm rndc
to use.
Currently only HMAC-MD5 is supported.
This is followed by a 
.Dv secret
clause which contains the base-64 encoding of the
algorithm's encryption key.
The base-64 string is enclosed in double quotes.
.Sh EXAMPLE
.Bd -literal indent
options {
        default-server  localhost;
        default-key     "samplekey";
};

server localhost {
        key     "samplekey";
};

key "samplekey" {
        algorithm       hmac-md5;
        secret          "strong enough for a man, but made for a woman";
};
.Ed
.Pp
In the above example,
.Nm rndc
will by default use the server at localhost (127.0.0.1) and the key called
.Dv samplekey .
Commands to the localhost server will use the
.Dv samplekey
key.
The
.Dv key{}
statement indicates that
.Dv samplekey
uses the HMAC-MD5 algorithm and its
.Dv secret
clause contains the base-64 encoding of the HMAC-MD5 secret enclosed
in double quotes.
