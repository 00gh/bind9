Document {min,max}-{refresh,retry}-time

min-refresh-time
max-refresh-time
min-retry-time
max-retry-time

	These options control the server's behavior on refreshing a zone
	(querying for SOA changes) or retrying failed transfers.
	Usually the SOA values for the zone are used, but these values
	are set by the master, giving slave server administrators little
	control over their contents.

	These options allow the administrator to set a minimum and maximum
	refresh and retry time either per-zone, per-view, or per-server.
	These options are valid for slave and stub zones, and clamp the SOA
	refresh and retry times to the specified values.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Limit the number of retries on socket errors (send and receive)

	-- Log when we get more than 10 of the same error in a row.
	-- Also catch "no route to host" and "write error on pipe"

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Make lwresd shut down its fetches properly

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Implement ip6.arpa priming

	-- Stub zones that don't have masters.

Non-priorities (as things stand for my work load at this time
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Write sample code for asynchronous resolution.

Rewrite zone code to use a list per zone state

Develop automated test for queries over IPv6

Move lwres search list handling to lwresd
