allow-notify:
	Accept notify messages which match this acl in addition to
	the zone masters.  Zone masters implicitly do not match.

notify-forward:
	If 'yes' forward notifies which match 'allow-notify' to zone
	masters.  If 'no' accept the notify which match 'allow-notify'
	as if it came from a master.  Default 'no'.

max-names:
	The maximum number of names allowed in a slave zone.
	If an incoming zone transfer contains more than this
	many names, the zone will be unloaded.


Also, the "masters" list for slave zones can contain per-master TSIG keys
using a syntax like "masters { 1.2.3.4 port 5555 key "foo." };".
