Preparing a bind9 release


Here's a rough outline of the steps to follow in preparing a new bind9
release.

 - Update the README file

 - Update doc/misc/options

 - Verify that the file "version" contains the correct version
   number (it should have been incremented after the
   previous release)

 - If this is a final release (not a beta), update the
   lib/*/api files as needed.  See the libtool info file
   for information about what the various numbers mean.

 - Check that http://status.isc.org/bind9/bind9.html shows 
   a clean build and test status for all supported systems.

 - Check that "make all_tests" does not produce compile errors.

 - Make sure that the most recent version of the ARM has been
   checked in.  Look for any obvious broken links in the
   .html files.

 - Announce a CVS pool freeze on bind-dev

 - Do basic tests on each build system:

    check out a source tree
    do a build
    test it:
      transfer in
      transfer out
      auth query
      recursive query
      exit cleanly with no leaks

 - On selected platforms, do more detailed tests:

    Using bind9 as a caching server during web surfing
    Resolving IPv6 addresses
    Doing queries over IPv6

 - Add a marker line like "	--- 9.0.0b3 released ---"
   to the CHANGES file.

 - Tag the CVS source tree with the final tag, as in
   "cvs rtag v9_0_0b3 bind9".

 - Export the source tree in to a fresh directory by
   running "cvs export", as in "cvs export -rv9_0_0b3 bind9"

 - Run "make kit" (actually, "sh configure && make kit").

 - Take the resulting distribution files to a secure system 
   and sign them with the ISC signing PGP key:
   "pgp -sba bind-9.0.0b3.tar.gz -u 0x51BAB2ED"

 - Change file permissions on the signature file to make sure
   it is not writable

 - Build bind9 from the kit on at least one machine
   and test it

 - Prepare a release announcement based on the previous one

 - Prepare new web site information

 - Verify the PGP signature:
   pgp bind-9.0.0b3.tar.gz.asc bind-9.0.0b3.tar.gz

 - Copy the distribution and PGP signature files to the FTP site:

     ssh isrv4.pa.vix.com "mkdir /udir/ftp/isc/bind9/9.0.0b4"
     scp bind-9.0.0b4.tar.gz bind-9.0.0b4.tar.gz.asc \
	isrv4.pa.vix.com:/udir/ftp/isc/bind9/9.0.0b4   

 - Download using FTP and verify the PGP signature again

 - Increment the version in the file "version"

 - Announce end of CVS pool freeze on bind-dev

 - Announce the release
