Preparing a bind9 release


Here's a rough outline of the steps to follow in preparing a new bind9
release.


 - Update the README file

 - Verify that VERSION contains the correct version
   number (it should have been incremented after the
   previous release)

 - Announce a CVS pool freeze on bind-dev

 - Do basic tests on each build system:

    check out a source tree
    do a build
    test it:
      transfer in
      transfer out
      auth query
      recursive query
      exit cleanly with no leaks

 - On selected platforms, do more detailed tests:

    Using bind9 as a caching server during web surfing
    Resolving IPv6 addresses
    Doing queries over IPv6

 - Tag the CVS source tree with the final tag

 - Export the source tree in to a fresh directory by
   running "cvs export"

 - Run "make kit"

 - Take the resulting distribution files to a secure system 
   and sign them with the ISC signing PGP key

 - Change file permissions on the signature file to make sure
   it is not writable

 - Build bind9 from the kit on at least one machine
   and test it

 - Prepare a release announcement based on the previous one

 - Prepare new web site information

 - Verify the PGP signature

 - Copy the distribution and PGP signature files to the FTP site

 - Download using FTP and verify the PGP signature again

 - Announce the release

 - Increment VERSION

 - Announce end of CVS pool freeze on bind-dev
