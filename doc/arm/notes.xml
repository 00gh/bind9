	  A flaw in delegation handling could be exploited to put
	  <command>named</command> into an infinite loop, in which
	  each lookup of a name server triggered additional lookups
	  of more name servers.  This has been addressed by placing
	  limits on the number of levels of recursion
	  <command>named</command> will allow (default 7), and
	  on the number of queries that it will send before
	  terminating a recursive query (default 50).
	</para>
	<para>
	  The recursion depth limit is configured via the
	  <option>max-recursion-depth</option> option, and the query limit
	  via the <option>max-recursion-queries</option> option.
	</para>
	<para>
	  The flaw was discovered by Florian Maury of ANSSI, and is
	  disclosed in CVE-2014-8500. [RT #37580]
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  Two separate problems were identified in BIND's GeoIP code that
	  could lead to an assertion failure. One was triggered by use of
	  both IPv4 and IPv6 address families, the other by referencing
	  a GeoIP database in <filename>named.conf</filename> which was
	  not installed. Both are covered by CVE-2014-8680. [RT #37672]
	  [RT #37679]
	</para>
	<para>
	  A less serious security flaw was also found in GeoIP: changes
	  to the <command>geoip-directory</command> option in
	  <filename>named.conf</filename> were ignored when running
	  <command>rndc reconfig</command>. In theory, this could allow
	  <command>named</command> to allow access to unintended clients.

	<para>
	  The serial number of a dynamically updatable zone can
	  now be set using
	  <command>rndc signing -serial <replaceable>number</replaceable> <replaceable>zonename</replaceable></command>.
	  This is particularly useful with <option>inline-signing</option>
	  zones that have been reset.  Setting the serial number to a value
	  larger than that on the slaves will trigger an AXFR-style
	  transfer.
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  When answering recursive queries, SERVFAIL responses can now be
	  cached by the server for a limited time; subsequent queries for
	  the same query name and type will return another SERVFAIL until
	  the cache times out.  This reduces the frequency of retries
	  when a query is persistently failing, which can be a burden
	  on recursive serviers.  The SERVFAIL cache timeout is controlled
	  by <option>servfail-ttl</option>, which defaults to 10 seconds
	  and has an upper limit of 30.
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  The new <command>rndc nta</command> command can now be used to
	  set a "negative trust anchor" (NTA), disabling DNSSEC validation for
	  a specific domain; this can be used when responses from a domain
	  are known to be failing validation due to administrative error
	  rather than because of a spoofing attack. NTAs are strictly
	  temporary; by default they expire after one hour, but can be
	  configured to last up to one week.  The default NTA lifetime
	  can be changed by setting the <option>nta-lifetime</option> in
	  <filename>named.conf</filename>. When added, NTAs are stored in a
	  file (<filename><replaceable>viewname</replaceable>.nta</filename>)
	  in order to persist across restarts of the named server.
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  The EDNS Client Subnet (ECS) option is now supported for
	  authoritative servers; if a query contains an ECS option then
	  ACLs containing <option>geoip</option> or <option>ecs</option>
	  elements can match against the the address encoded in the option.
	  This can be used to select a view for a query, so that different
	  answers can be provided depending on the client network.
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  The EDNS EXPIRE option has been implemented on the client
	  side, allowing a slave server to set the expiration timer
	  correctly when transferring zone data from another slave
	  server.

	  A new <option>masterfile-style</option> zone option controls

      <listitem>
	<para>
	  The rate limiter configured by the
	  <option>serial-query-rate</option> option no longer covers
	  NOTIFY messages; those are now separately controlled by
	  <option>notify-rate</option> and
	  <option>startup-notify-rate</option> (the latter of which

	  is first started up or reconfigured).

	  The default number of tasks and client objects available

      <listitem>
	<para>
	  <command>named</command> will now check to see whether
	  other name server processes are running before starting up.
	  This is implemented in two ways: 1) by refusing to start
	  if the configured network interfaces all return "address
	  in use", and 2) by acquiring a file lock on
	  <filename>/var/run/named/named.lock</filename>, or on a different
	  file specified via the <command>named -X</command> command
	  line option.
	</para>

      <listitem>
	<para>
	  <command>rndc delzone</command> can now be applied to zones
	  which were configured in <filename>named.conf</filename>;
	  it is no longer restricted to zones which were added by
	  <command>rndc addzone</command>.  (Note, however, that
	  this does not edit <filename>named.conf</filename>; the zone
	  must be removed from the configuration or it will return
	  when <command>named</command> is restarted or reloaded.)
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  <command>rndc showzone</command> displays the current
	  configuration for a specified zone.
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  Added server-side support for pipelined TCP queries.  Multiple
	  queries from a single client can be received over the same TCP
	  connection; the connection is no longer closed after the first
	  query.  All queries received over such a connection are handled
	  in parallel.
	</para>
	<para>
	  To revert to the former behavior for a particular
	  client address or range of addresses, specify the address prefix
	  in the "keep-response-order" option.  To revert to the former
	  behavior for all clients, use "keep-response order { any; };".

	  ACLs containing <command>geoip asnum</command> elements were
	  not correctly matched unless the full organization name was
	  specified in the ACL (as in
	  <command>geoip asnum "AS1234 Example, Inc.";</command>).

	  When using native PKCS#11 cryptography (i.e.,

	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  NXDOMAIN responses to queries of type DS are now cached separately
	  from those for other types. This helps when using "grafted" zones
	  of type forward, for which the parent zone does not contain a
	  delegation, such as local top-level domains.  Previously a query
	  of type DS for such a zone could cause the zone apex to be cached
	  as NXDOMAIN, blocking all subsequent queries.  (Note: This
	  change is only helpful when DNSSEC validation is not enabled.
	  "Grafted" zones without a delegation in the parent are not a
	  recommended configuration.)
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>

	  Update forwarding performance has been improved by allowing
	  a single TCP connection to be shared between multiple updates.
	</para>

      <listitem>
	<para>
	  By default, <command>nsupdate</command> will now check
	  the correctness of hostnames when adding records of type
	  A, AAAA, MX, SOA, NS, SRV or PTR.  This behavior can be
	  disabled with <command>check-names no</command>.

      <listitem>
	<para>
	  The names of the files used to store managed keys and added
	  zones for each view are no longer based on the SHA256 hash
	  of the view name, except when this is necessary because the
	  view name contains characters that would be incompatible with use
	  as a file name.  For views whose names do not contain forward
	  slashes ('/'), backslashes ('\'), or capital letters - which
	  could potentially cause namespace collision problems on
	  case-insensitive filesystems - files will now be named
	  after the view (for example, <filename>internal.mkeys</filename>
	  or <filename>external.nzf</filename>).  However, to ensure
	  consistent behavior when upgrading, if a file using the old
	  name format is found to exist, it will continue to be used.

      <listitem>
	<para>
	  "rndc" can now return text output of arbitrary size to
	  the caller. (Prior to this, certain commands such as

      <listitem>
	<para>
	  When encountering an authoritative name server whose name is
	  an alias pointing to another name, the resolver treats
	  this as an error and skips to the next server. Previously
	  this happened silently; now the error will be logged to
	  the newly-created "cname" log category.

      <listitem>
	<para>
	  If named is not configured to validate the answer then
	  allow fallback to plain DNS on timeout even when we know

	  blocked.
