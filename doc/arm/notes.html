  <p>
    BIND 9.17 is an unstable development release of BIND.
    This document summarizes new features and functional changes that
    have been introduced on this branch.  With each development release
    leading up to the stable BIND 9.18 release, this document will be
    updated with additional features added and bugs fixed.
  </p>
  <p>
    Please see the file <code class="filename">CHANGES</code> for a more
    detailed list of changes and bug fixes.

<a name="relnotes_platforms"></a>Supported Platforms</h3></div></div></div>
  <p>
    To build on UNIX-like systems, BIND requires support for POSIX.1c
    threads (IEEE Std 1003.1c-1995), the Advanced Sockets API for
    IPv6 (RFC 3542), and standard atomic operations provided by the
    C compiler.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <code class="filename">libuv</code> asynchronous I/O library and the
    OpenSSL cryptography library must be available for the target
    platform.  A PKCS#11 provider can be used instead of OpenSSL for
    Public Key cryptography (i.e., DNSSEC signing and validation),
    but OpenSSL is still required for general cryptography operations
    such as hashing and random number generation.
  </p>
  <p>
    More information can be found in the <code class="filename">PLATFORMS.md</code>
    file that is included in the source distribution of BIND 9.  If your
    compiler and system libraries provide the above features, BIND 9
    should compile and run. If that isn't the case, the BIND
    development team will generally accept patches that add support
    for systems that are still supported by their respective vendors.
