      BIND 9.12.0 is a new feature release of BIND, still under development.
      This document summarizes new features and functional changes that
      have been introduced on this branch.  With each development
      release leading up to the final BIND 9.12.0 release, this document
      will be updated with additional features added and bugs fixed.

<a name="relnotes_license"></a>License Change</h3></div></div></div>
    <p>
      With the release of BIND 9.11.0, ISC changed to the open
      source license for BIND from the ISC license to the Mozilla
      Public License (MPL 2.0).
    </p>
    <p>
      The MPL-2.0 license requires that if you make changes to
      licensed software (e.g. BIND) and distribute them outside
      your organization, that you publish those changes under that
      same license. It does not require that you publish or disclose
      anything other than the changes you made to our software.
    </p>
    <p>
      This new requirement will not affect anyone who is using BIND
      without redistributing it, nor anyone redistributing it without
      changes, therefore this change will be without consequence
      for most individuals and organizations who are using BIND.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those unsure whether or not the license change affects their
      use of BIND, or who wish to discuss how to comply with the
      license may contact ISC at <a class="link" href="https://www.isc.org/mission/contact/" target="_top">
      https://www.isc.org/mission/contact/</a>.
