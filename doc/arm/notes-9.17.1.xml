	  When an RPZ policy zone was updated via zone transfer
	  and a large number of records were deleted, <command>named</command>
	  could become nonresponsive for a short period while deleted
	  names were removed from the RPZ summary database. This database
	  cleanup is now done incrementally over a longer period of time,
	  reducing such delays. [GL #1447]
