      <title>It's not working; how can I figure out what's wrong?</title>

      <para>The best solution to solving installation and
      configuration issues is to take preventative measures by setting
      up logging files beforehand (see the sample configurations in
      <xref linkend="sample_configuration"/>). The log files provide a
      source of hints and information that can be used to figure out
      what went wrong and how to fix the problem.</para>

    <title>Incrementing and Changing the Serial Number</title>

    <para>Zone serial numbers are just numbers-they aren't date
    related.  A lot of people set them to a number that represents a
    date, usually of the form YYYYMMDDRR. A number of people have been
    testing these numbers for Y2K compliance and have set the number
    to the year 2000 to see if it will work. They then try to restore
    the old serial number. This will cause problems because serial
    numbers are used to indicate that a zone has been updated. If the
    serial number on the slave server is lower than the serial number
    on the master, the slave server will attempt to update its copy of
    the zone.</para>

    <para>Setting the serial number to a lower number on the master
    server than the slave server means that the slave will not perform
    updates to its copy of the zone.</para>

    <para>The solution to this is to add 2147483647 (2^31-1) to the
    number, reload the zone and make sure all slaves have updated to
    the new zone serial number, then reset the number to what you want
    it to be, and reload the zone again.</para>
