          In this release, the build system has been significantly changed (see
          below), and there's number of unresolved issues that you need to be
          aware of if you are using a development release.  Please refer to
          GitLab issue #4 https://gitlab.isc.org/isc-projects/bind9/-/issues/4
          for a list of not yet resolved issues that will be fixed in the
          following releases.

          The BIND 9 build system has been changed to use the normal build tool
          stack consisting of autoconf+automake+libtool.  This should not make
          any difference for people building BIND 9 from the release tarballs,
          but if you are building BIND 9 from the git repository you will need
          to run "autoreconf -fi" first. If you are using non-standard
          <command>./configure</command> option, you will
          need to pay extra attention. [GL #4]

          The native PKCS#11 EdDSA implementation has been updated to PKCS#11
          v3.0 and thus made operational again.  Contributed by Aaron Thompson.

          When running on a system with Linux capabilities support,
          <command>named</command> drops root privileges very soon after system
          startup. This was causing a spurious log message, <quote>unable to set
          effective uid to 0: Operation not permitted</quote>, which has now been
          silenced. [GL #1042] [GL #1090]
