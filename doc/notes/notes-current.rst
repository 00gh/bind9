Feature Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``ipv4only.arpa`` is now served when ``dns64`` is configured. [GL #385]

- When using the ``unixtime`` or ``date`` method to update the SOA
  serial number, ``named`` and ``dnssec-signzone`` silently fell back to
  the ``increment`` method to prevent the new serial number from being
  smaller than the old serial number (using serial number arithmetics).
  ``dnsssec-signzone`` now prints a warning message, and ``named`` logs
  a warning, when such a fallback happens. [GL #2058]

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Only assign threads to CPUs in the CPU affinity set, so that ``named`` no
  longer attempts to run threads on CPUs outside the affinity set. Thanks to
  Ole Bj√∏rn Hessen. [GL #2245]
