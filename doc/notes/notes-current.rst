Notes for BIND 9.17.9
---------------------

Security Fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- None.

Known Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- None.

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``ipv4only.arpa`` is now served when DNS64 is configured. [GL #385]

Removed Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- A number of non-working configuration options that had been marked
  as obsolete in previous releases have now been removed completely.
  Using any of the following options is now considered a configuration
  failure:
  ``acache-cleaning-interval``, ``acache-enable``, ``additional-from-auth``,
  ``additional-from-cache``, ``allow-v6-synthesis``, ``cleaning-interval``,
  ``dnssec-enable``, ``dnssec-lookaside``, ``filter-aaaa``,
  ``filter-aaaa-on-v4``, ``filter-aaaa-on-v6``, ``geoip-use-ecs``, ``lwres``,
  ``max-acache-size``, ``nosit-udp-size``, ``queryport-pool-ports``,
  ``queryport-pool-updateinterval``, ``request-sit``, ``sit-secret``,
  ``support-ixfr``, ``use-queryport-pool``, ``use-ixfr``. [GL #1086]

Feature Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- It is now possible to transition a zone from secure to insecure mode
  without making it bogus in the process; changing to ``dnssec-policy
  none;`` also causes CDS and CDNSKEY DELETE records to be published, to
  signal that the entire DS RRset at the parent must be removed, as
  described in RFC 8078. [GL #1750]

- The default value of ``max-stale-ttl`` has been changed from 12 hours to 1
  day and the default value of ``stale-answer-ttl`` has been changed from 1
  second to 30 seconds, following RFC 8767 recommendations. [GL #2248]

- When using the ``unixtime`` or ``date`` method to update the SOA
  serial number, ``named`` and ``dnssec-signzone`` silently fell back to
  the ``increment`` method to prevent the new serial number from being
  smaller than the old serial number (using serial number arithmetics).
  ``dnssec-signzone`` now prints a warning message, and ``named`` logs a
  warning, when such a fallback happens. [GL #2058]

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Multiple threads could attempt to destroy a single RBTDB instance at
  the same time, resulting in an unpredictable but low-probability
  assertion failure in ``free_rbtdb()``. This has been fixed. [GL #2317]

- ``named`` no longer attempts to assign threads to CPUs outside the CPU
  affinity set. Thanks to Ole Bj√∏rn Hessen. [GL #2245]

- When reconfiguring ``named``, removing ``auto-dnssec`` did not turn
  off DNSSEC maintenance. This has been fixed. [GL #2341]

- The report of intermittent BIND assertion failures triggered in
  ``lib/dns/resolver.c:dns_name_issubdomain()`` has now been closed
  without further action. Our initial response to this was to add
  diagnostic logging instead of terminating ``named``, anticipating that
  we would receive further useful troubleshooting input. This workaround
  first appeared in BIND releases 9.17.5 and 9.16.7. However, since
  those releases were published, there have been no new reports of
  assertion failures matching this issue, but also no further diagnostic
  input, so we have closed the issue. [GL #2091]

- KASP incorrectly set signature validity to the value of the DNSKEY signature
  validity. This is now fixed. [GL #2383]
