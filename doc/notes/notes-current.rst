Notes for BIND 9.17.18
----------------------

Security Fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- None.

Known Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- None.

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- None.

Removed Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Native PKCS#11 support has been removed; BIND 9 now uses OpenSSL engine_pkcs11 from the
  OpenSC project. :gl:`#2691`

Feature Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``named`` and ``named-checkconf`` now issue a warning when there is a single
  configured port in the ``query-source``, ``transfer-source``,
  ``notify-source``, and ``parental-source``, and/or in their respective IPv6 counterparts.
  :gl:`#2888`

- ``named`` and ``named-checkconf`` now return an error when the single configured
  port in the ``query-source``, ``transfer-source``, ``notify-source``,
  ``parental-source``, and/or their respective IPv6 counterparts clashes with the
  global listening port. This configuration is no longer supported as of BIND
  9.16.0 but no error was reported, although sending UDP messages
  (such as notifies) would fail. :gl:`#2888`

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- When new IP addresses were added to the system during ``named``
  startup, ``named`` failed to listen on TCP for the newly added
  interfaces. :gl:`#2852`
