This is an attempt at an LDAP back-end for BIND 9 using the new
simplified database interface "sdb". This is the third release
(0.3) and is not ready for production use yet. Bug reports,
fixes, comments, questions or whatever, please contact me. See
also http://www.venaas.no/ldap/bind-sdb/ for information.

See INSTALL for how to build, install and use.
