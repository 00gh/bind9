Code Drop 3 Status Update

Work since the last code drop has focused on both the libraries and
the server.  Some of the highlights are:

	Libraries
		IPv6 sockets.

		DNSSEC security core, TSIG.

		Shared libraries can now be generated.

		Internationalization message catalog support.  (Much of the
		code has yet to be converted to use catalogs.)

	Server
		Most of the temporary code in the server has been replaced
		with the real thing.  One exception is config file processing,
		which has not yet been integrated.

		Basic AXFR, IXFR, and dynamic update support.
		
		The server now listens on IPv6 sockets, if the system
		supports them.

		The IPv6 reverse lookup scheme (bitstring labels and DNAME)
		is supported by the server.  A6 chain following remains
		to be implemented.

		DNSSEC NXT records are returned in negative responses
		for secure zones.

	Resolver
		The skeleton of the resolver is in the kit.  This
		shows how the resolver is going to work, but the
		resolver is not yet functional.  This will be the
		prime focus of work in the near future.


Building

We've had successful builds and tests on the following systems

	BSDI 3.1
	Digital UNIX 4.0D
	HP-UX 11
	NetBSD
	Red Hat Linux 6.0
	SGI IRIX 6.5
	Solaris 2.6

To build, just

	./configure
	make

Do not run 'make install'.  Shared libraries will be built if "--with-libtool"
is added to the "configure" command.

Building with gcc is not supported, unless gcc is the vendor's usual
compiler (e.g. the various BSD systems, Linux).


bin/named Note

The configuration code in bin/named does not represent the final
architecture.  The config file processing code in lib/dns/config will be
used by the server in the future.  The server is still running on port
5544.


API Note

All APIs are subject to change in future code drops.  We expect the
existing library interfaces in the code drop to be quite stable,
however, and unless we've specifically indicated that an interface is
temporary, we don't expect significant changes in future releases.
