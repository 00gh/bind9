BIND 9

	BIND version 9 is a major rewrite of nearly all aspects of the
	underlying BIND architecture.  Some of the important features of
	BIND 9 are:

		- DNS Security
			DNSSEC (signed zones)
			TSIG (signed DNS requests)

		- IP version 6
			Answers DNS queries on IPv6 sockets
			IPv6 resource records (A6, DNAME, etc.)
			Bitstring Labels
			Experimental IPv6 Resolver Library

		- DNS Protocol Enhancements
			IXFR, DDNS, Notify, EDNS0
			Improved standards conformance

		- Views
			One server process can provide multiple "views" of
			the DNS namespace, e.g. an "inside" view to certain
			clients, and an "outside" view to others.

		- Multiprocessor Support

		- Improved Portability Architecture


	BIND version 9 development has been underwritten by the following
	organizations:

		Sun Microsystems, Inc.
		Hewlett Packard
		Compaq Computer Corporation
		IBM
		Process Software Corporation
		Silicon Graphics, Inc.
		Network Associates, Inc.
		U.S. Defense Information Systems Agency
		USENIX Association
		Stichting NLnet - NLnet Foundation



BIND 9.1.0a1

	This is an unreleased alpha version of BIND 9.1.0.

	For a detailed list of user-visible changes from
	previous releases, see the CHANGES file.


Building

	BIND 9 currently requires a UNIX system with an ANSI C compiler,
	basic POSIX support, and a good pthreads implementation.

	We've had successful builds and tests on the following systems:

		AIX 4.3
		COMPAQ Tru64 UNIX 4.0D
                COMPAQ Tru64 UNIX 5 (with IPv6 EAK)
		FreeBSD 3.4-STABLE, 3.5, 4.0, 4.1
		HP-UX 11
		IRIX64 6.5
		NetBSD-current (with unproven-pthreads-0.17)
		Red Hat Linux 6.0, 6.1, 6.2
		Solaris 2.6, 7, 8

	Additionally, we have unverified reports of success from users
	of the following systems:

		Slackware Linux 7.0 with 2.4.0-test6 kernel and glibc 2.1.3
		UnixWare 7.1.2 once the IN6_IS_ADDR_MULTICAST macro in
			/usr/include/netinet/in6_f.h is repaired (== vs =).

	To build, just

		./configure
		make

        Several environment variables that can be set before running
        configure will affect compilation:

            CC
                The C compiler to use.  configure tries to figure
                out the right one for supported systems.

            CFLAGS
                C compiler flags.  Defaults to include -g and/or -O2
                as supported by the compiler.

            STD_CINCLUDES
                System header file directories.  Can be used to specify
                where add-on thread or IPv6 support is, for example.
                Defaults to empty string.

            STD_CDEFINES
                Any additional preprocessor symbols you want defined.
                Defaults to empty string.

        To build shared libraries, specify "--with-libtool" on the
	configure command line.

	If your operating system has integrated support for IPv6, it
	will be used automatically.  If you have installed KAME IPv6
	separately, use "--with-kame[=PATH]" to specify its location.

        To see additional configure options, run "configure --help".

	"make install" will install "named" and the various BIND 9 libraries.
	By default, installation is into /usr/local, but this can be changed
	with the "--prefix" option when running "configure".

	If you're planning on making changes to the BIND 9 source, you
	should also "make depend".  If you're using Emacs, you might find
	"make tags" helpful.

	Building with gcc is not supported, unless gcc is the vendor's usual
	compiler (e.g. the various BSD systems, Linux).

	Parts of the library can be tested by running "make test" from the
	bin/tests subdirectory.


Documentation

	The BIND 9 Administrator Reference Manual is included with the
	source distribution in HTML and plain text format, in the
	doc/arm directory.  A PDF version can be downloaded separately
	at <http://www.nominum.com/resources/>.

	Some of the programs in the BIND 9 distribution have man pages
	under the doc/man directory.  In particular, the command line
	options of "named" are documented in doc/man/bind/named.8.

	The man pages are currently not installed automatically by
	"make install".

	If you are upgrading from BIND 8, please read the migration
	notes in doc/misc/migration.
