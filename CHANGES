 112.   [cleanup]       <isc/serial.h> does not need <isc/boolean.h>.

 111.   [cleanup]       <isc/rwlock.h> does not need <isc/result.h> or
                        <isc/mutex.h>.

 110.   [cleanup]       <isc/result.h> does not need <isc/boolean.h> or
                        <isc/list.h>.

 109.   [bug]           "make depend" did nothing for
                        bin/tests/{db,mem,sockaddr,tasks,timers}/.

 108.   [cleanup]       DNS_SETBIT/DNS_GETBIT/DNS_CLEARBIT moved from
                        <dns/types.h> to <dns/bit.h> and renamed to
                        DNS_BIT_SET/DNS_BIT_GET/DNS_BIT_CLEAR.

 107.   [func]		Add keysigner and keysettool.

                        implicit conventions the developers have used.

 104.   [bug]           Made compress_add and compress_find static to
                        lib/dns/compress.c.

 103.   [func]          libisc buffer API changes for <isc/buffer.h>:
                        Added:
                                isc_buffer_base(b)          (pointer)
                                isc_buffer_current(b)       (pointer)
                                isc_buffer_active(b)        (pointer)
                                isc_buffer_used(b)          (pointer)
                                isc_buffer_length(b)            (int)
                                isc_buffer_usedlength(b)        (int)
                                isc_buffer_consumedlength(b)    (int)
                                isc_buffer_remaininglength(b)   (int)
                                isc_buffer_activelength(b)      (int)
                                isc_buffer_availablelength(b)   (int)
                        Removed:
                                ISC_BUFFER_USEDCOUNT(b)
                                ISC_BUFFER_AVAILABLECOUNT(b)
                                isc_buffer_type(b)
                        Changed names:
                                isc_buffer_used(b, r) ->
                                        isc_buffer_usedregion(b, r)
                                isc_buffer_available(b, r) ->
                                        isc_buffer_available_region(b, r)
                                isc_buffer_consumed(b, r) ->
                                        isc_buffer_consumedregion(b, r)
                                isc_buffer_active(b, r) ->
                                        isc_buffer_activeregion(b, r)
                                isc_buffer_remaining(b, r) ->
                                        isc_buffer_remainingregion(b, r)

                        Buffer types were removed, so the ISC_BUFFERTYPE_*
                        macros are no more, and the type argument to
                        isc_buffer_init and isc_buffer_allocate were removed.
                        isc_buffer_putstr is now void (instead of isc_result_t)
                        and requires that the caller ensure that there
                        is enough available buffer space for the string.

 102.   [port]          Correctly detect inet_aton, inet_pton and inet_ptop

  88.   [cleanup]       <isc/interfaceiter.h> does not need <isc/result.h> or
                        <isc/mem.h>.  isc_interface_t and isc_interfaceiter_t
                        moved to <isc/types.h>.

  87.   [cleanup]       <isc/heap.h> does not need <isc/boolean.h>,
                        <isc/mem.h> or <isc/result.h>.

  86.   [cleanup]       isc_bufferlist_t moved from <isc/bufferlist.h> to

                        <isc/int.h>.

  84.	[func]		allow-query ACL checks now apply to all data
			added to a response.

  83.	[func]		If the server is authoritative for both a
			delegating zone and its (nonsecure) delegatee, and
			a query is made for a KEY RR at the top of the
			delegatee, then the server will look for a KEY
			in the delegator if it is not found in the delegatee.

  82.   [cleanup]       <isc/buffer.h> does not need <isc/list.h>.

  81.   [cleanup]       <isc/int.h> and <isc/boolean.h> do not need
                        <isc/lang.h>.

  80.   [cleanup]       <isc/print.h> does not need <stdio.h> or <stdlib.h>.

  79.   [cleanup]       <dns/callbacks.h> does not need <stdio.h>.

  78.   [cleanup]       lwres_conftest renamed to lwresconf_test for
                        consistency with other *_test programs.

  77.   [cleanup]       typedef of isc_time_t and isc_interval_t moved from
                        <isc/time.h> to <isc/types.h>.  

  76.   [cleanup]	Rewrote keygen.

  75.   [func]          Don't load a zone if its database file is older
                        than the last time the zone was loaded.

  74.   [cleanup]       Removed mktemplate.o and ufile.o from libisc.a,
                        subsumed by file.o.

  73.   [func]          New "file" API in libisc, including new function
                        isc_file_getmodtime, isc_mktemplate renamed to
                        isc_file_mktemplate and isc_ufile renamed to
                        isc_file_openunique.  By no means an exhaustive API,
                        it is just what's needed for now.

  72.   [func]          DNS_RBTFIND_NOPREDECESSOR and DNS_RBTFIND_NOOPTIONS
                        added for dns_rbt_findnode, the former to disable the
                        setting of the chain to the predecessor, and the
                        latter to make clear when no options are set.

  71.   [cleanup]       Made explicit the implicit REQUIREs of
                        isc_time_seconds, isc_time_nanoseconds, and
                        isc_time_subtract.

  70.   [func]          isc_time_set() added.

  69.   [bug]		The zone object's master and also-notify lists grew
			longer with each server reload.

  68.	[func]		Partial support for SIG(0) on incoming messages.

  67.	[performance]	Allow use of alternate (compile-time supplied)
			OpenSSL libraries/headers.

  66.   [func]		Data in authoritative zones should have a trust level
			beyond secure.

  65.   [cleanup]       Removed obsolete typedef of dns_zone_callbackarg_t
			from <dns/types.h>.

  64.	[func]		The RBT, DB, and zone table APIs now allow the
			caller find the most-enclosing superdomain of
			a name.

  63	[func]		Generate NOTIFY messages.

  62.	[func]		Add UDP refresh support.

  61.   [cleanup]       Use single quotes consistently in log messages.

  60.	[func]		Catch and disallow singleton types on message
			parse.

  59.	[bug]		Cause net/host unreachable to be a hard error
			when sending and receiving.

  58.	[bug]		bin/named/query.c could sometimes trigger the
			(client->query.attributes & NS_QUERYATTR_NAMEBUFUSED)
			== 0 assertion in query_newname().

  56.	[bug]		SIG records were not properly returned in cached
			negative answers.

  55.	[bug]		Responses containing multiple names in the authority
			section were not negatively cached.

  54.	[bug]		If a fetch with sigrdataset==NULL joined one with
			sigrdataset!=NULL or vice versa, the resolver
			could catch an assertion or lose signature data,
			respectively.

  53.	[port]		freebsd 4.0: lib/isc/unix/socket.c requires
			<sys/param.h>.

  52.	[bug]		rndc: taskmgr and socketmgr were not initaliased
			to NULL.

  51.   [cleanup]       dns/compress.h and dns/zt.h did not need to include
                        dns/rbt.h; it was needed only by compress.c and zt.c.

  50.   [func]          RBT deletion no longer requires a valid chain to work,
                        and dns_rbt_deletenode was added.

  49.	[func]		Each cache now has its own mctx.

  48.	[func]		isc_task_create() no longer takes an mctx.
			isc_task_mem() has been eliminated.

  47.	[func]		A number of modules now use memory context reference
			counting.

  46.	[func]		Memory contexts are now reference counted.
			Added isc_mem_inuse() and isc_mem_preallocate().
			Renamed isc_mem_destroy_check() to
			isc_mem_setdestroycheck().

  45.	[bug]		The trusted-key statement incorrectly loaded keys.

  44.	[bug]		Don't include authority data if it would force us
			to unset the AD bit in the message.

  43.	[bug]		DNSSEC verification of cached rdatasets was failing.

  42.	[cleanup]	Simplified logging of messages with embedded domain
			names by introducing a new convenience function
			dns_name_format().

  41.	[func]		Use PR_SET_KEEPCAPS on Linux 2.3.99-pre3 and later
			to allow 'named' to run as a non-root user while
			retaining the ability to bind() to privileged
			ports.

  40.	[func]		Introduced new logging category "dnssec" and
			logging module "dns/validator".

  39.	[cleanup]	Moved the typedefs for isc_region_t, isc_textregion_t, 
			and isc_lex_t to <isc/types.h>.

  38.	[bug]		TSIG signed incoming zone transfers work now.

  37.	[bug]		If the first RR in an incoming zone transfer was 
			not an SOA, the server died with an assertion failure
			instead of just reporting an error.

  36.	[cleanup]	Change DNS_R_SUCCESS (and others) to ISC_R_SUCCESS

  35.   [performance]   Log messages which are of a level too high to be
                        logged by any channel in the logging configuration
                        will not cause the log mutex to be locked.

  34.   [bug]           Recursion was allowed even with 'recursion no'.

  33.   [func]          The RBT now maintains a parent pointer at each node.

  32.   [cleanup]       bin/lwresd/client.c needs <string.h> for memset()
                        prototype.

  31.   [bug]           Use ${LIBTOOL} to compile bin/named/main.@O@.

  30.	[func]		config file grammer change to support optional 
			class type for a view.

  29.	[func]		support new config file view options:

				auth-nxdomain recursion query-source
				query-source-v6 transfer-source
				transfer-source-v6 max-transfer-time-out
				max-transfer-idle-out transfer-format
				request-ixfr privide-ixfr cleaning-interval
				fetch-glue notify rfc2308-type1 lame-ttl
				max-ncache-ttl min-roots

  28.	[func]		support lame-ttl, min-roots and serial-queries 
			config global options.
			
  27.   [bug]           Only include <netinet6/in6.h> on BSD/OS 4.[01]*.
                        Including it on other platforms (eg, NetBSD) can
                        cause a forced #error from the C preprocessor.

  26.	[func]		new match-clients statement in config file view.

  25.	[bug]		make install failed to install <isc/log.h> and
			<isc/ondestroy.h>.

  24.	[cleanup]	Eliminate some unnecessary #includes of header
			files from header files.

  23.	[cleanup]	Provide more context in log messages about client
			requests, using a new function ns_client_log().

  22.   [bug]		SIGs weren't returned in the answer section when
			the query resulted in a fetch.

  21.   [port]          Look at STD_CINCLUDES after CINCLUDES during
                        compilation, so additional system include directories
                        can be searched but header files in the bind9 source
                        tree with conflicting names take precedence.  This
                        avoids issues with installed versions of dnssafe and
                        openssl.

  20.	[func]		Configuration file post-load validation of zones
			failed if there were no zones.

  19.	[bug]		dns_zone_notifyreceive() failed to unlock the zone
			lock in certain error cases.

  18.   [bug]           Use AC_TRY_LINK rather than AC_TRY_COMPILE in
                        configure.in to check for presence of in6addr_any.

  17.	[func]		Do configuration file post-load validation of zones.

  16.	[bug]		put quotes around key names on config file 
			output to avoid possible keyword clashes.

  15.	[func]		Add dns_name_dupwithoffsets().  This function is
			improves comparison performance for duped names.

  14.	[bug]		free_rbtdb() could have 'put' unallocated memory in
			an unlikely error path.

  13.	[bug]		lib/dns/master.c and lib/dns/xfrin.c didn't ignore
			out-of-zone data.

  12.	[bug]		Fixed possible unitialized variable error.

  11.	[bug]		axfr_rrstream_first() didn't check the result code of
			db_rr_iterator_first(), possibly causing an assertion
			to be triggered later.

  10.	[bug]		A bug in the code which makes EDNS0 OPT records in
			bin/named/client.c and lib/dns/resolver.c could
			trigger an assertion.

   9.   [cleanup]	replaced bit-setting code in confctx.c and replaced
			repeated code with macro calls.

   8.   [bug]		Shutdown of incoming zone transfer accessed
			freed memory.

   7.   [cleanup]	removed 'listen-on' from view statement.

   6.   [bug]		quote RR names when generating config file to 
			prevent possible clash with config file keywords 
			(such as 'key').

   5.   [func]		syntax change to named.conf file: new ssu grant/deny 
			statements must now be enclosed by an 'update-policy'
			block.

   4.	[port]		bin/named/unix/os.c didn't compile on systems with
			linux 2.3 kernel includes due to conflicts between
			C library includes and the kernel includes.  We now
			get only what we need from <linux/capability.h>, and
			avoid pulling in other linux kernel .h files.

   3.	[bug]		TKEYs go in the answer section of responses, not
			the additional section.

   2.	[bug]		Generating cryptographic randomness failed on
			systems without /dev/random.

   1.	[bug]		The installdirs rule in
			lib/isc/unix/include/isc/Makefile.in had a typo which
			prevented the isc directory from being created if it
			didn't exist.
