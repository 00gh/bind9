  13.	[bug]		lib/dns/master.c and lib/dns/xfrin.c didn't ignore
			out-of-zone data.

  12.	[bug]		Fixed possible unitialized variable error.

  11.	[bug]		axfr_rrstream_first() didn't check the result code of
			db_rr_iterator_first(), possibly causing an assertion
			to be triggered later.

  10.	[bug]		An bug in the code which makes EDNS0 OPT records in
			bin/named/client.c and lib/dns/resolver.c could
			trigger an assertion.

   9.   [cleanup]	replaced bit-setting code in confctx.c and replaced
			repeated code with macro calls.

   8.   [bug]		Shutdown of incoming zone transfer accessed
			freed memory.

   7.   [cleanup]	removed 'listen-on' from view statement.

   6.   [bug]		quote RR names when generating config file to 
			prevent possible clash with config file keywords 
			(such as 'key').

   5.   [func]		syntax change to named.conf file: new ssu grant/deny 
			statements must now be enclosed by an 'update-policy'
			block.

   4.	[port]		bin/named/unix/os.c didn't compile on systems with
			linux 2.3 kernel includes due to conflicts between
			C library includes and the kernel includes.  We now
			get only what we need from <linux/capability.h>, and
			avoid pulling in other linux kernel .h files.

   3.	[bug]		TKEYs go in the answer section of responses, not
			the additional section.

   2.	[bug]		Generating cryptographic randomness failed on
			systems without /dev/random.

   1.	[bug]		The installdirs rule in
			lib/isc/unix/include/isc/Makefile.in had a typo which
			prevented the isc directory from being created if it
			didn't exist.
