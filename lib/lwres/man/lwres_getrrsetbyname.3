.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Pp
.Fn lwres_getrrsetbyname
is used to get a set of resource records associated with a
.Fa hostname ,
.Fa class ,
and
.Fa type .
.Fa hostname
is
a pointer a to null-terminated string.  The
.Fa flags
field is currently unused.
.Pp
After a successful call to
.Fn lwres_getrrsetbyname ,
.Fa *res
is a pointer to an
.Dv rrsetinfo
structure, containing a list of one or more
.Dv rdatainfo
structures containing resource records and potentially another list of
.Dv rdatainfo
structures containing signatures.
The members
.Li rri_rdclass
and
.Li rri_rdtype
are copied from the parameters.
.Li rri_ttl
and
.Li rri_name
are properties of the obtained rrset.
The resource records contained in
.Li rri_rdatas
and
.Li rri_sigs
are in uncompressed DNS wire format.
Properties of the rdataset are represented in the
.Li rri_flags
bitfield.  If the RRSET_VALIDATED bit is set, the data has been DNSSEC
validated and the signatures verified.  If the RRSET_AUTHORITATIVE bit
is set, the queried ligghtweight resolver server was authoritative for the
data.
.Pp
All of the information returned by
.Fn lwres_getrrsetbyname
is dynamically allocated: the
.Li rrsetinfo
and
.Li rdatainfo
structures,
and the canonical host name strings pointed to by the
.Li rrsetinfo structure.
Memory allocated for the dynamically allocated structures created by
a successful call to
.Fn lwres_getrrsetbyname
is released by
.Fn lwres_freerrset .
.Fa rrset
is a pointer to a
.Dv "struct rrset"
created by a call to
.Fn lwres_getrrsetbyname .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn lwres_getrrsetbyname
returns zero on success or an error code if an error occurs.  The defined
error codes are ERRSET_NOMEMORY (memory could not be allocated),
ERRSET_INVAL (a parameter is invalid) and ERRSET_FAIL (other failure).
